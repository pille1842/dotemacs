** What is this?
This document, referred to in the source code as =erix-emacs.org=, contains most of my configurations for GNU Emacs. In its structure it is heavily influenced by Protesilaos Stavrou's well-documented and beautifully presented [[https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs][Emacs configuration]]. Its contents also frequently borrow from "Prot", but I have been equally inspired by the System Crafters YouTube series [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEoMzSkcN8oPH1au7H6B7bBJ4ZO7BXjSZ][Emacs From Scratch]], a repository of which can be found on [[https://github.com/daviwil/emacs-from-scratch][GitHub]].

My Emacs configuration is designed using the principles of literate programming. Each section not only contains the code that will automatically produce the actual Emacs configuration file, but it also contains additional information, links to sources, annotations and comments to make this document a more useful resource for its human readers.

This document is written using Orgmode. When starting Emacs, a =erix-emacs.el= file is automatically produced and loaded, containing all the Emacs Lisp source code blocks in this file. Another initialization file exists for the sole purpose of bootstrapping this document.

** General design considerations
This configuration relies mainly on the [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] macro which makes creating a reproducible and consistent configuration much easier. This document lays out which packages are needed for a fully configured Emacs, and how each of these packages should in turn be fine-tuned to my liking. Use-package will ensure that all these packages are actually installed on the system from which this configuration is run.

This configuration has been tested on the following system:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :exports results
  (format "System type:   %s\nOS release:    %s\nEmacs version: %s"
          system-type
          operating-system-release
          emacs-version)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: System type:   gnu/linux
: OS release:    5.8.0-48-generic
: Emacs version: 27.1

** Contents of my init.el
These are the contents of =init.el=, which is responsible for tangling (i.e. extracting the source code blocks from) and loading this document.

#+include: init.el src emacs-lisp :tangle no

* Custom file
Instead of appending customizations done via the custom interface to =init.el=, I would like Emacs to put them into a separate file. This file will be loaded at the end of this configuration to override any settings done via Lisp.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (custom-set-default 'custom-file (concat user-emacs-directory "custom.el"))
#+end_src

* Interface
This section adapts the Emacs interface to be less cluttered and to look cleaner and, arguably, more beautiful than what the default Emacs experience provides for.

** Clean up the UI
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (tool-bar-mode -1)
  (scroll-bar-mode -1)
  (tooltip-mode -1)
  (set-fringe-mode 10)
  (setq visible-bell t
        inhibit-splash-screen t
        frame-title-format '(multiple-frames "%b"
                                             "Emacs"))
#+end_src

** Cursor type
There are a few shapes available for the cursor in Emacs:

- =box= (which is the default)
- =hollow= (a hollow box)
- =bar= (a vertical bar)
- =hbar= (a horizontal bar)
- =nil= (no cursor at all).

No cursor at all seems a little too minimalistic, so the =bar= type is used instead. You can actually set the cursor for each individual buffer via the buffer-local variable =cursor-type=, but for consistency, the same cursor shape will be used throughout.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq-default cursor-type 'bar)
#+end_src

** Font
[[https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode][Fira Code]] is a free monotype font containing ligatures for common programming multi-character combinations. To prepare for the terrible case that Fira Code is not installed on the system, an additional check is performed using the =fc-list= program which should be in your PATH.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun erix-font-installed-p (font)
    "Return t if the given FONT is installed on the system, nil otherwise.

  This works by calling the fc-list program to search for fonts
  matching the given pattern."
    (not
     (string= ""
              (shell-command-to-string
               (concat "fc-list "
                       (shell-quote-argument font))))))

  (defvar erix-default-font-name "Fira Code Retina" "Default font name")
  (defvar erix-default-font-size 120 "Default font size")

  (when (erix-font-installed-p erix-default-font-name)
    (set-face-attribute
     'default nil
     :font erix-default-font-name
     :height erix-default-font-size))
#+end_src

*** Ligatures

In typography, a ligature occurs when two or more graphemes or letters are joined as a single glyph. One defining feature of Fira Code is that it contains ligatures for grapheme groups commonly used in various programming languages. There is a package to make this feature work in Emacs. The minor mode will be enabled in all =prog-mode= buffers. This is taken from the [[https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/Emacs-instructions][Fira Code Emacs instructions]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package fira-code-mode
    :hook prog-mode)
#+end_src

** Theme
[[https://draculatheme.com/][Dracula]] is a theme available for many applications, including various terminal emulators, vim, Visual Studio Code, and Emacs.

This is a probably a pretty wasteful way to use Dracula in Emacs: It is part of the [[https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes][doom-themes]] package (together with a gazillion others that will go unused).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package doom-themes
    :init (load-theme 'doom-dracula t))
#+end_src

*** Screenshot
Here is a screenshot of the init.el file generated from this document, rendered in the Dracula theme:
